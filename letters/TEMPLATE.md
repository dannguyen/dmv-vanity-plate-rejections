To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the **NAME OF THE STATE FOI LAW**, I hereby request the following documents:

A list of all personalized license plates that were rejected by the **STATE NAME** Department of Motor Vehicles for the year 2016.

If available I am also looking for:

- The reason for the rejection of the personalized plate.
- The vehicle make and model.
- The City and County where the applicant's vehicle would be registered.

I am NOT looking for any personal identifiable information such as first and last name, street number, street name.

I also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge. The documents will be processed by a representative of the news media/press for the purpose of news gathering and not for commercial usage.

In the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I would request your response within **NUMBER OF DAYS MANDATED IN STATE LAW** business days.

Sincerely,

**YOUR NAME GOES HERE**
